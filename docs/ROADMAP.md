REQUIREMENTS  
Terraform configured with S3 buckets and RDS / DynamoDB that will be "plugged" into the backend  
    NOTE: Utilize strict IAM policies

Key ideas ðŸ’¡:  
    - Ideally, we will only have to call `terraform apply` and it will deploy everything.  
    - Ideally, for local development, we will only have to call `docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build` and it will just work.  
    - I also want full test-coverage. Ideally, we take images of databases to speed up testing.  
    - Full E2E testing with cypress using docker containers to spin up database instances for testing and then tear them down.  

TODO:  
[ðŸ¦œ] Terraform to deploy everything to ðŸ‘‰ AWS ECS, set up an S3 bucket, RDS PostgresSQL, CDN for âš¡ speedy page-loads,
[ðŸ¦œ] Maybe make a python script or something that generates all the TF files needed to deploy every function in the `./lambda` folder. Python should work on all OS's so I kinda prefer it over Bash ðŸ˜µ rn.  
[ðŸ¦œ] Configure Prisma on backend  
[ðŸ¦œ] Docker Compose with e2e testing + database
